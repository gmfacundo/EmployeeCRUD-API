# Employee CRUD API
This development is made with ASP.NET Core and Docker.

## Get Started
You can get the softwares needed form its official website:
- [Docker](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
- [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)
- [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)

## To test the API:
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

## Have in mind:

- Docker for Windows requires Microsoft Hyper-V to run, this feature is only available 64bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise and Education.

- If you have other Windows version, you can use Docker Toolbox. 

- After opening Docker for Windows you may get an error like “Unable to open Docker, user not in docker-users”, check Virtualization option is enabled in BIOS.

- On Toolbox version, after opening Quickstart Terminal you might get the following error “This computer doesn’t have VT-X/AMD-v enabled. Enabling in BIOS is mandatory”.

## Step by step development.
You can follow this [link](https://medium.com/@gmf.facundo/asp-net-core-and-docker-working-together-42723eb7f3f) to know how to develop this API.

## Documentation
You can read [documentation for ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-2.1), including Docker usage in the [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/) and a introduction to [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/).
